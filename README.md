# Connect to a CSV - Guided Project

## TLDR

Update a CSV file.

### What is this, really?

I'm just showing how to connect to csv files and update them if needed.

### What do I need?

An OpenAI key, which yes means you have to have a credit card. You can get an OpenAI key[here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
If you would like to see how your agents are performing, you can also create a Langchain account.

### How do I get it to work?

Clone this repository to a directory. Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`.

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the `csv_ai_reader.ipynb` notebook for a step by step or `yelp_scraper.py` with your version of Python from your command line.
